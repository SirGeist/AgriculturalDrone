Group F's Agricultural Drone for CSC 414 - Software Design - University of Southern Mississippi

You MUST use Unity version 2021.3.8f1 and it is highly recommended to use Unity Hub to manage your installation.

How to download project:

Install git
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Open git bash and navigate to your Unity Projects folder. If you haven't made one, feel free to make it wherever you would like. I keep mine in my documents folder.
You can navigate by using the cd & ls command like bash on linux. (ie. cd users/user/Documents) 
To naviagate to a folder with a space in it you would type in cd Unity\ Projects for instance.

Once you have navigated to the folder you want your Unity project to be in, type in:

"git clone https://github.com/gibbyb/AgriculturalDrone"

Open Unity Hub, click open, navigate to the folder you chose and select the AgriculturalDrone folder and click open.
