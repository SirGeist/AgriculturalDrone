Group F's Agricultural Drone for CSC 414 - Software Design - University of Southern Mississippi

You MUST use Unity version 2021.3.8f1 and it is highly recommended to use Unity Hub to manage your installation.

How to download project:

Install git
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Open git bash and navigate to your Unity Projects folder. If you haven't made one, feel free to make it wherever you would like. I keep mine in my documents folder.
You can navigate by using the cd & ls command like bash on linux. (ie. cd users/user/Documents) 
To naviagate to a folder with a space in it you would type in cd Unity\ Projects for instance.

Once you have navigated to the folder you want your Unity project to be in, type in:

"git clone https://github.com/gibbyb/AgriculturalDrone"

Open Unity Hub, click open, navigate to the folder you chose and select the AgriculturalDrone folder and click open. 


In the assets folder, click on the LowPolyFarmLite/Scenes/LowPolyFarmLite_Demo.unity scene. 

Once the scene is opened, just press play and you can then fly the drone.

Take picture w/ top-down camera:    G
Head to waypoint: P


*If the camera does not change perspectives, follow these steps:
1) Open the project in unity and click on "Edit" in the top left corner
2) Click on "Project Settings" [Should be sixth from the bottom]
3) On the left-hand side of the project settings window, locate the "Input Manager" tab
4) Once there, look under axes to see if "1Key", "2Key", and or "3Key" are missing [make note of the last dropdown].
5) If they are missing, scroll up to the "Size" box [just under the axes dropdown], and add 3 to that current number.
6) Scroll back down, and you will notice that the last dropdown was duplicated 3 times. 
   Click on the first duplicated dropdown, and modify the values so that it is the same as the
   image that I posted above. Do this step 2 more times for the remaining duplicates naming and
   changing the "Positive" value for "2Key" and "3Key" respectively.
